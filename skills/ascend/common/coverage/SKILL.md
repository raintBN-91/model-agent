# Coverage Skill

Use when working with coverage, generated from official documentation.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill should be triggered when:
- Working with coverage
- Asking about coverage features or APIs
- Implementing coverage solutions
- Debugging coverage code
- Learning coverage best practices

## Quick Reference

### Common Patterns

**Pattern 1:** XML reporting: coverage xml The xml command writes coverage data to a “coverage

```
coverage xml
```

**Pattern 2:** Combining data files: coverage combine Often test suites are run under different conditions, for example, with different versions of Python, or de...

```
coverage combine
```

**Pattern 3:** HTML reporting: coverage html Coverage

```
coverage html
```

**Pattern 4:** Diagnostics: coverage debug The debug command shows internal information to help diagnose problems

```
coverage debug
```

**Pattern 5:** Installation You can install coverage

```
$ python3 -m pip install coverage
```

**Pattern 6:** If you are installing on Linux, you may need to install the python-dev and gcc support files before installing coverage via pip

```
$ sudo apt-get install python-dev gcc
$ sudo yum install python-devel gcc

$ sudo apt-get install python3-dev gcc
$ sudo yum install python3-devel gcc
```

**Pattern 7:** Text annotation: coverage annotate Note The annotate command has been obsoleted by more modern reporting tools, including the html command

```
coverage annotate
```
